# Theta Security System  

**Theta Security System** is an innovative low-cost security solution developed as a college thesis project. This system combines affordability with advanced technology to provide robust and efficient security. Developed by:  
- **Charles Adrian Cabontocan - Programmer**  
- **Carlo Jan Harry A√±onuevo - Programmer**  
- **Mar-con Prince Owen Difuntorum - Documentation**  

## üìñ Overview  
The Theta Security System utilizes cost-effective hardware and open-source software to address the need for affordable yet reliable security systems. Built around the **Orange Pi Zero 3**, it leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques for smart intrusion detection and facial recognition.

## üåü Features  
- **Affordable Hardware**: Built using the **Orange Pi Zero 3**, a low-cost yet powerful alternative to traditional systems.  
- **Facial Recognition**: Implements **Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH)** for accurate face recognition.  
- **Intrusion Detection**: Utilizes **Haar Cascade Classifiers** for real-time detection of unauthorized access.  
- **Open-Source Frameworks**: Powered by **OpenCV** for image processing and machine learning tasks.  
- **Lightweight and Scalable**: Designed for small-scale deployments with options for scaling to larger setups.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Hardware**: Orange Pi Zero 3  
- **Facial Recognition**: LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)  
- **Intrusion Detection**: Haar Cascade Classifier  
- **Software Libraries**: OpenCV (for computer vision tasks)  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  

## üöÄ How It Works  
1. **Setup and Registration**: Users register facial data into the system using a webcam or other camera input.  
2. **Monitoring**: The system continuously captures and processes video streams to detect faces and movements.  
3. **Recognition and Alerting**:  
   - Known faces: System allows access.  
   - Unknown faces or anomalies: Triggers an alert via the configured notification channel.  
4. **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts are sent instantly via email or SMS.  

## üí° Use Cases  
- Home security systems  
- Small offices or retail spaces  
- Low-cost security solutions for rural or underserved areas  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Setup  
- **Orange Pi Zero 3** (or equivalent low-cost single-board computer)  
- USB or built-in camera for video input  
- Optional: External storage for logs or backups  

## ü§ù Acknowledgments  
We extend our gratitude to our mentors, professors, and peers who provided guidance and support throughout this project.

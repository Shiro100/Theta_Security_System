# Theta Security System  

**Theta Security System** is an innovative college thesis project designed to enhance security measures using advanced technology. This system was developed by:  
- **Charles Adrian Cabontocan**  
- **Carlo Jan Harry Añonuevo**  
- **Mar-con Prince Owen Difuntorum**  

## 📖 Overview  
The Theta Security System is a cutting-edge solution aimed at providing robust and efficient security for various applications. It incorporates modern tools and technologies to address the challenges of security threats in both residential and commercial spaces.  

## 🌟 Features  
- **Smart Intrusion Detection**: Uses AI-driven algorithms to detect and alert users of unauthorized access.  
- **Face Recognition Technology**: Enables secure access control through facial authentication.  
- **Customizable Notifications**: Users can configure alerts and notifications based on their preferences.  
- **Scalable Design**: Built to adapt and scale for larger installations.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **AI & Machine Learning**: For face recognition and intrusion detection.  
- **IoT Integration**: Supports smart home and smart building setups.  
- **Database Management**: Securely stores user profiles and activity logs.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Registration**: Users register their profiles and set access parameters.  
2. **Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors the environment using cameras and sensors.  
3. **Detection**: AI algorithms analyze data in real-time to identify anomalies or unauthorized access.  
4. **Alerting**: Sends instant notifications to users via email, SMS, or app-based alerts.
